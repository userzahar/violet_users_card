# Violet Card

Our website allows you to view user cards, which display the number of their
followers and tweets, and also gives you the opportunity to subscribe to a user.

## How the site works.

When the page loads, you will see a list of user cards. These cards contain
information about users, such as their photo and a short description. By
clicking the "follow" button on their cards, you can subscribe to them.
Additionally, there is a "load more" button at the bottom for displaying more
user cards.
